# breakfast_club_nft
Home for all back-end implementations relevant to the Breakfast Club NFT project family.

This project is being developed for Solana, and is an exploration into the concept of
making a blockchain game entirely live on the blockchain, with the UI only acting as
a wrapper for smart contract interactions.
